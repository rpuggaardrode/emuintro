# Creating an Emu database from .wav files {#sec-wav2emu}

## Preliminaries

```{r}
#| echo: false

#Make sure that directory of emuDBs is empty before proceeding

d <- list.dirs('emu_databases')[-1]
unlink(d, recursive=TRUE)
```

If you want to code along with this chapter, you should download and unzip the file `testsample` (accessible [here](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~jmh/lehre/Rdf/testsample.zip){target="_blank"}). Store the `testsample` folder in the `ipsR` directory you made when you did the initial setup for the tutorial. Also create as directory called `emu_databases` on your machine in the `ipsR` directory. The directory should now look like this:

![](img/emu2021.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

Now start up R and load the following libraries:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(emuR)
library(wrassp)
```

In R, store the path to the directory `testsample` under the name `sourceDir` in the following way:

```{r}
sourceDir <- "./testsample"
```

And also store in R the path to `emu_databases` as `targetDir`:

```{r}
targetDir <- "./emu_databases"
```

Note that if you source this tutorial directly from GitHub, these documents and file structures are already available in the tutorial R project. 
<!--# Perhaps add a link to the GitHub page once the final link is up? Or should this be a callout box explaining how to do this, or perhaps include such a callout block in the setup doc?-->

## Creating an Emu database from scratch

In this chapter, we will see how to build an Emu database from scratch. 

One of the test samples you downloaded earlier is called `german`. Store the path to this directory as below: 

```{r}
path.german <- file.path(sourceDir, "german")
```

This database contains the following sound files (we use the `pattern="*wav"` argument to get only files where the name ends in `wav`).

```{r}
list.files(path.german, pattern = "*wav")
```

We create an empty database using the `create_emuDB()` command:

```{r}
create_emuDB(name = "german", 
             targetDir = targetDir)
```

This can now be loaded in using the `load_emuDB()` command we saw in the previous chapter.

```{r}
german_DB <- load_emuDB(file.path(targetDir, "german_emuDB"))
```

What's in the database? Nothing!

```{r}
summary(german_DB)
```

We can import the WAV files in our German test sample into the database using the `import_mediaFiles()` command:

```{r}
import_mediaFiles(german_DB, dir = path.german, verbose = FALSE)
```

What's in the database now? Not nothing!

```{r}
summary(german_DB)
```

The following bundles are available:

```{r}
list_bundles(german_DB)
```

Note that all bundles are associated with a session. If the sound files all come from a single directory, they are assigned to a session called `0000`. If our `testsample/german` directory had had multiple subdirectories, these would be assigned to different sessions with the same names as the subdirectories. 

You can now `serve()` the database and have a look at the data.

```{r}
#| eval: false

serve(german_DB, useViewer = F)
```

We're almost always interested in adding annotations to our databases. You can add an annotation level using the `add_levelDefinition()` function. Annotation levels need a name (we call this one `Phon`) and a type. The type is `SEGMENT` because we want to add annotation units with start and end times; the different types of annotation levels (`SEGMENT`, `ITEM`, and `EVENT`) were presented in the previous chapter.

```{r}
add_levelDefinition(german_DB, 
                    name = "Phon", 
                    type = "SEGMENT",
                    verbose=FALSE)
```

Will this new annotation level be shown when we `serve()` the database again? We can check this with `get_levelCanvasesOrder()`, as seen in the previous chapter

```{r}
get_levelCanvasesOrder(german_DB, 
                       perspectiveName = "default")
```

Nope! New annotation levels are not shown by default, but need to be explicitly added to a perspective with the function `set_levelCanvasesOrder()`.

```{r}
set_levelCanvasesOrder(german_DB, 
                       perspectiveName = "default", 
                       order = "Phon")
```

If we now `serve()` the database, the `Phon` level should be visible. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

serve(german_DB, useViewer = F)
```

It's still empty though. Try to annotate some segments as in @fig-annotex, e.g. /O, a/ for the vowels of *Sonne* and *lacht* in `K01BE002` and save the annotations.

## Some information about annotating in Emu

The procedure for entering annotations into Emu may not be immediately intuitive especially if you are used to doing this in Praat. Once you get the hang of it, though, it is very fast!

**Creating an interval** can be done as in Praat. Place your cursor at the desired start point of an interval, then left click your mouse and hold it while dragging your cursor to the desired end point of an interval, and then let go of the clicker. (If this sounds complicated -- it isn't! Don't overthink it, just think of it as the usual way to mark some interval with your mouse.) Now hit the enter key on your keyboard. This should draw two vertical lines signaling the boundaries of your segment.

If you don't want to create an interval but simply one boundary, simply place your cursor somewhere in the spectrogram or waveform, left click your mouse, and hit the enter key. This should draw a single vertical line.

**Deleting a boundary** can be done by simply placing your cursor near the boundary you want to delete. You should see it turn from right to blue -- this means that it is selected, you don't need to click it. Now hit the backspace key on your keyboard. This should delete the boundary, and if relevant, it will combine the text in two adjacent intervals. If you want to delete an interval including the annotations in it, left click somewhere within the interval and press Shift + Backspace. This will expand the surrounding intervals.

To **enter a label**, left click inside an interval, and hit the enter key. Alternatively you can use your arrow keys to move left and right between intervals, and hit the enter keys when you have found the one you want to edit. If you have just created a boundary, it is automatically selected, and you can hit enter right away to start entering a label. The interval will now turn bright yellow, and you can type in text. When you are done typing, hit the enter key again. 

To **move a boundary**, simply place your cursor near a boundary as explained above, hold down the Shift key, and move your cursor left to right. Let go of the Shift key when the boundary is in the right position.

To **save an annotation**, either hit Shift + S, or left click on the Save icon next to the bundle name in the left side your Emu window; it will have turned red.

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

#create annotations programmatically so the query below will not fail
annot_info <- data.frame(session = rep('0000', 4), bundle = rep('K01BE002', 4), 
                   level=rep('Phon', 4), attribute=rep('Phon', 4),
                   start_item_seq_idx = c(1048.5, 1111.7, 1275, 1391.1),
                   labels = c('O', '', 'a', ''), db_uuid=german_DB$UUID)
create_itemsInLevel(german_DB, annot_info, verbose=F)
```

Assuming you have managed to annotate the segments as in @fig-annotex above, the segments should now be accessible in R with the function `query()`. (As mentioned in @sec-intro, the Emu query language is one-of-a-kind and very flexible! It will be discussed in much more detail in @sec-query.)

```{r}
query(german_DB, "Phon =~ .*")
```


## Adding word annotations

The next task is to add orthographic labels as `ITEM` annotations. This should be done if either (a) the start and end times are of no concern and/or (b) a word's start and end time are inherited from segments. There are three steps:

Add a new level to the database using the command `add_levelDefinition()`. Here we add one with the name `ORT`:

```{r}
add_levelDefinition(german_DB, 
                    name = "ORT", 
                    type = "ITEM",
                    verbose=FALSE)
```

Define how it is linked with a time-based level, in this case with `Phon`. We do this with the command `add_linkDefinition`. The different `type`s of link were discussed in @sec-first_steps.

```{r}
add_linkDefinition(german_DB, 
                   type = "ONE_TO_MANY", 
                   superlevelName = "ORT", 
                   sublevelName = "Phon")
```

Finally, we can check that the hierarchical links are as expected using the function `list_linkDefinitions()`.

```{r}
list_linkDefinitions(german_DB)
```

### Adding `ITEM` annotations via the `EMU-webApp`

Open the hierarchy window for utterance `K01BE001`, and click on the blue and white `+` sign next to `ORT`. Each time you do so, a node appears. You can enter annotation text for any node by positioning the mouse over it and then left click to bring up a green rectangle (see figure below) into which you can type text and then hit enter. To delete a node, move the mouse over it and hit the `y` key. Further details can be seen in the figure below.

![](img/hier1.png)

If you have done something as in the above figure, you should be able to access the annotations in R. Notice the `NA` under start and end times. This is because they are *timeless*, i.e. unlinked to any annotations of a time (`SEGMENT` or `EVENT`) tier.

```{r}
#| echo: false

#create annotations programmatically so the query below will not fail
annot_info <- data.frame(session = rep('0000', 4), bundle = rep('K01BE001', 4), 
                   level=rep('ORT', 4), attribute=rep('ORT', 4),
                   start_item_seq_idx = 1:4,
                   labels = c('heute', 'ist', 'schönes', 'Frühlingswetter'), 
                   db_uuid=german_DB$UUID)
create_itemsInLevel(german_DB, annot_info, verbose=F)
```

```{r}
query(german_DB, "ORT=~.*")
```

### Adding `ITEM` annotations via the `emuR`

You can also add timeless annotations (in this case to the `ORT` tier) with the function `create_itemsInLevel()`. This requires passing a data frame with certain specific requirements to the `itemsToCreate` argument. This data frame should have the columns `labels`, `session`, `bundle`, `level`, `start_item_seq_idx`, and `attribute`, with one row for each annotation to be added. In this example, the words *die Sonne lacht* will be added to the second utterance.

Let's make a data frame with this information step-by-step. First, we store the sentence as a vector `w` with a string corresponding to each word:

```{r}
w <- c("die", "Sonne", "lacht")
```

What session do the labels belong to? In this case there is only one session, `0000`. Make a vector with the same length as `w` which repeats the session name.

```{r}
sess <- rep("0000", length(w))
```

What bundle do the labels belong to?

```{r}
bundle <- rep("K01BE002", length(w))
```

What's the name of the annotation level? This will be `ORT` as created above, and in this case the attribute name is identical to the level name (see @sec-intro for more details). 

```{r}
lev <- rep("ORT", length(w))
```

What order do the annotations occur in? This is 1, 2, 3 for *die Sonne lacht*.

```{r}
inds <- 1:length(w)
```

Put all the above information into a data frame as follows:

```{r}
newItems_ORT <- data.frame(session = sess, 
                          bundle = bundle, 
                          level = lev, 
                          start_item_seq_idx = inds,
                          attribute = lev, 
                          labels = w,
                          stringsAsFactors = F)
newItems_ORT
```

Add these word annotations to the database:

```{r}
create_itemsInLevel(german_DB, newItems_ORT, 
                    verbose=FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Using `create_itemsInLevel()` with `SEGMENT` or `EVENT` levels

You can also add annotation items for annotation levels with time information, i.e. `SEGMENT` or `EVENT` levels. This requires a data frame with the same columns as `newItems_ORT` which we created above, but instead of having numeric indexes in the column `start_item_seq_idx`, this column should contain the start time in ms of the selected boundary. (In the case of an `EVENT` level, this should be called `start` instead of `start_item_seq_idx`).

If you're creating annotation items programmatically in a `SEGMENT` tier in this way, you'll likely also want to add an end time. Somewhat counterintuitively, you do this by adding another row to the data frame with an empty label. If we wanted to use `create_itemsInLevel()` to create the vowel labels in `K01BE002` that we made manually below, we would do it like this:

```{r}

w <- c("O", "", "a", "")
sess <- rep("0000", length(w))
bundle <- rep("K01BE002", length(w))
lev <- rep("Phon", length(w))
times <- c(1048.5, 1111.7, 1275, 1391.1)

newItems_Phon = data.frame(session = sess, 
                          bundle = bundle, 
                          level = lev, 
                          start_item_seq_idx = times,
                          attribute = lev, 
                          labels = w,
                          stringsAsFactors = F)
newItems_Phon
```

The `newItems_Phon` can now be passed onto the `create_itemsInLevel()` function as we saw above. This of course requires us to know our boundary times already, but one can easily imagine a situation where signal processing tools are used to find landmarks in sound files, and these landmarks are then used to create boundaries. 

<!-- reference getVOT directly? -->

:::

If we use `query()` as above, we should now see words in both bundles:

```{r}
query(german_DB, "ORT=~.*")
```

Have a look at the database again:

```{r}
#| eval: false

serve(german_DB, useViewer = F)
```

Look at the hierarchy for the second utterance. The word annotations in the `ORT` tier should now be visible. These can be linked manually in the `Emu-WebApp` so that the word labels are accessible in `emuR`. Please see [section 9.2.2 of the Emu SDMS manual](https://ips-lmu.github.io/The-EMU-SDMS-Manual/chap-emu-webApp.html#working-with-hierarchical-annotations-2-chapemu-webapp) for details on how to annotate hierarchically.

::: {.callout-note}
## Some information about annotating hierarchically

Adding hierarchical links and annotations is not difficult. The present task is to add links from `O` and from `a` at the `Phon` tier to `Sonne` and to `lacht` respectively at the `ORT` tier. To do this for the first of these, hover the mouse over `Sonne` (the node will turn blue), hold down the shift key, and sweep the mouse to `O` (whose node will also turn blue), release the shift key, and the link is made. If you want to delete the link, hover the mouse over it (the link will then turn bright yellow) and hit backspace. 

You can add new nodes at the `ORT` tier as follows: Move the mouse over `lacht`, type `n` and hit enter. This will create a new node *before* `lacht` (between `Sonne` and `lacht`). If you enter `m` instead of `n` in the above operation, a new node will be created *after* `lacht`. To edit or play a node at the `ORT` tier, left click on the node. You can enter or modify text in the green panel. To denote a node at the `ORT` tier, hover over it and enter `y`. See figure below.

![](img/hier2.png)
:::


If you have annotated as in the above figure and saved it, the words and their times will be accessible (note that the times at the `ORT` level and the same as the times at the `Phon` level, because each word only dominates one segment (and inherits its times from those). Note also that `die` has no times, because it hasn't been linked to any annotations at the `Phon` level. We can check this with query:

```{r}
#| eval: false

query(german_DB, "ORT =~ .*", bundlePattern = "K01BE002")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

#this is just a bit of cheating to print the result as a tibble.
#I couldn't think of a way to do this programmatically
q <- query(german_DB, "ORT =~ .*", bundlePattern = "K01BE002")
q$start <- c(NA, 1042.781, 1279.719)
q$end <- c(NA, 1116.594, 1369.469)
q
```
