# A schematic overview of the Emu Speech Database Management System {#sec-intro}

## Background

The core idea behind Emu today is just the same as it was when it first launched in the mid-late 1980s at [CSTR, Edinburgh University](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/){target='_blank'} and known as APS which stood for [Acoustic Phonetics in S](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~jmh/papers/aps.pdf){target='_blank'}.

The core idea of Emu is:

- A speech database is a *collection of utterances* consisting of signal (waveform, formant, f0 etc) and annotation (label) files.
- There is a *query language*: annotations can be extracted from the database and read directly into R. It should be straightforward to e.g. find all tokens of [i] in the database.
- These queried lists of annotations in R can be further queried to get the corresponding signals (e.g. find the formants of the [i] tokens extracted at the previous step).

There have been some landmark changes to Emu since the APS--Edinburgh days of the 1980s.

(@) In the 1990s (at Linguistics, Macquarie University, Sydney), Emuâ€™s query language was updated to handle *hierarchically structured annotations*: see especially @cassidy2001. (The name Emu evolved out of **E**xtended **MU**lti-dimensional and because we were in Australia). The query language is still in use today and is the only one of its kind in existence.

The point of hierarchical annotations is to be able to query annotations at one tier with respect to another. For example the previous query could be extended to:

- Find all `[i]` vowels in the first syllable of trisyllabic accented words, but only if they are preceded by a function word in any `L%` intonational phrase.

(@) From 2002--2006, the **A**dvanced **S**peech **S**ignal **P**rocessor (ASSP) toolkit developed by Michel Scheffers of the IPdS, University of Kiel was integrated into Emu [@bombien2006]. ASSP then morphed into the R package `wrassp` ca. 2014.

(@) In the last few years, the Emu engine was completely overhauled by Raphael Winkelmann with many excellent new features [see also @winkelmann2017], e.g.:

- Emu is launched and operates entirely within the R programming environment.
- An interactive graphical user interface for analysing and visualising data: the `Emu-webApp`
- Extension of the query language to include regular expressions.
- Far more rapid access to extracting annotations and their signal files from the database.
